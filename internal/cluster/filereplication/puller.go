// Package filereplication implements peer-to-peer Parquet file replication
// for Arc Enterprise clusters without shared storage. It is the byte-level
// counterpart to Phase 1's cluster-wide file manifest: when a new file is
// announced on the Raft log, the puller downloads the bytes from the origin
// peer over the coordinator TCP protocol, verifies the SHA-256, and writes
// the file to the local storage backend.
//
// The puller is gated by the Enterprise license (FeatureClustering) and
// wired by the coordinator when cluster.replication_enabled is true.

// consumes — it scopes "ready" to the cold-start window, not to whatever
// is in flight at any given moment.
//
// The predicate is deliberately scoped to the catch-up batch, not to all
// inflight pulls. Steady-state ingest (a writer flushes a file → FSM
// callback → reactive Enqueue) constantly puts entries in flight in any
// healthy cluster. Gating queries on those would mean the reader returns
// 503 every few seconds in normal operation, which defeats the gate's
// purpose and breaks query availability. The gate's job is "the reader
// has finished bootstrapping its view of the cluster manifest," not
// "no pulls are happening anywhere right now."
//
// Self-heal: catchupFailed and catchupDropped both decrement when a later
// successful pull resolves a previously-affected path, or when the entry is
// deleted from the cluster manifest (OnManifestDelete, fired by the FSM on
// every node, including for the paths a snapshot restore drops since #962;
// pruneStaleCatchUpState covers what neither reaches), so transient peer
// outages, queue-saturation events, and entries
// no peer can serve don't require a process restart to clear the gate.
// Periodic reconciliation cannot create or remove startup tags, and its
// failures cannot reopen readiness, but its successful pulls can heal
// existing path state. The puller tracks affected paths in
// catchupFailedPaths and catchupDroppedPaths; worker success calls
// clearCatchUpFailure and clearCatchUpDrop (both are no-ops when the path was
// never recorded).
//
// Returns false (not ready) if:
//   - the catch-up walker never ran or hasn't completed, OR
//   - any path the walker enqueued is still in flight, OR
//   - a catch-up-tagged pull failed (catchupFailed > 0) and hasn't been
//     resolved by a later success, OR
//   - a catch-up entry was dropped (catchupDropped > 0).
//
// Failures and drops outside the catch-up window do NOT keep the gate red.
// They're operational concerns surfaced via Stats() but not correctness
// blockers — by the time the catch-up batch has settled, this reader has
// reconciled its view of the manifest as of walker start. Steady-state
// failures are handled by reactive FSM callbacks (which re-enqueue), the
// Phase 5 reconciler (sweeps drift between manifest and storage), and
// operator alerting via the cumulative failed/dropped counters.
//
// Returning true on a node where the puller never ran (OSS / standalone) is
// the caller's responsibility — see Coordinator.ReplicationReady, which
// short-circuits when the puller is nil. When the catch-up walker is
// disabled via cluster.replication_catchup_enabled=false the operator has
// explicitly opted out of the bootstrap safety net; in that case the
// coordinator should treat ReplicationReady() as always true (the

// and, if so, hashes its bytes so the fetch client can continue the SHA-256
// chain over the tail. Returns (offset, hasher) on success, or (0, nil) if
// there is no usable partial file (not found, too large, or hash failed).
//
// Note: a non-zero offset is only ever returned for a backend with a staging
// area, and LocalBackend is both the only StagingInspector and the only
// AppendingBackend — so writeFileTail's ErrResumeNotSupported branch is
// unreachable in every shipping configuration. It is kept because the two
// interfaces are independent by contract.
//
// statErr here can no longer be storage.ErrInvalidPath, and the (0, nil) return
// is therefore not ambiguous between "no partial" and "unusable key": the same
// key already went through StatFile at the top of processEntry, which
// quarantines and returns before any of this runs (#747). The same invariant is
// why deleteFile below cannot be called with an unusable key. Both are pinned
// by a test asserting the backend sees no Delete for a quarantined entry.
//
// A resume is sized and hashed from the STAGED partial alone, never from a
// committed file, and is refused outright when a committed file exists. The
// refusal is what is load-bearing; sizing and hashing through the staging API
// is defence in depth, since StatFile and ReadToAt fall back to the staging
// file exactly when no committed file exists — the only state the refusal lets
// through. Going through StagedSize/ReadStaged additionally means a committed
// file appearing between the two calls cannot silently retarget the hash. StatFile prefers the committed object and only falls
// back to the staging file, and ReadToAt does the same; writeFileTail, by
// contrast, appends to the staging file (AppendReader). Sizing or hashing with
// the StatFile/ReadToAt pair therefore hashes the prefix of one file and
// appends the tail to a different one. Once a rejected fetch stops deleting the
// committed copy (#999), that is reachable: a committed previous generation
// shorter than the entry would be hashed as the "prefix", the new tail appended
// to the staging file, and — whenever the old generation happens to be a byte
// prefix of the new one — the combined digest VERIFIES and a tail-only file is
// renamed into place. Same hazard statLocal guards on the presence side (#963).
