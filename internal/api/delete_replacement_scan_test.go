// class: a replacement scan has no function name to match, and the keyword
// list covers SELECT and UNION but not the other spellings DuckDB accepts
// for introducing a relation.

// The endpoint is admin-gated, so this is defence in depth rather than a
// privilege boundary — but the fragment is user-supplied text reaching the
